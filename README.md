    <h1>SimplyText</h1>
    <br />
     <p>SimplyText is a functional and usable interface from a minimalist perspective. With only three icons at the bottom for the customary Phone, Email, and Messages buttons, SimplyText is a sleek and powerful design for those who are wanting more usability out of their homescreen without all the added fluff and color.</p>
      <p>The layout itself is comprised of four main widgets wrapped around a large empty square designed to house a seperate widget from your favorite native calendar. Each individual box has both a touch square overlaying the entire box. This makes button presses quick and painless as the entire visible area, not just the text, will open a specified application / shortcut.</p>
      <p>The beauty of SimplyText is the way everything is organized in KWGT. Unlike a lot of themes out there with nested and mis-matched modules, SimplyText is organized in a logical and structured way that is not only easy to navigate but also easy to manipulate. Each widget is layed out systematically from the root folder down. All geographic areas have their own Overlap group, with each item nested neatly within making changes relatively easy to accomplish. This also makes moving and copying item-groups a breeze. THis also makes transitioning from one device to the next simple as scaling generally accomplishes resolution changes quickly and effectively.</p>
      <p> The four main components are shown below. Also note that for the SimplyText_Middle widget, there is an additional singleline 5 button widget available.</p>
