    <h1>SimplyText</h1>
    <p>SimplyText is a functional and usable interface from a minimalist perspective. With only three icons at the bottom for the customary Phone, Email, and Messages buttons, SimplyText is a sleek and powerful design for those who are wanting more usability out of their homescreen without all the added fluff and color.</p>
    <p>The layout itself is comprised of four main widgets wrapped around a large empty square designed to house a seperate widget from your favorite native calendar. Each individual box has both a touch square overlaying the entire box. This makes button presses quick and painless as the entire visible area, not just the text, will open a specified application / shortcut.</p>
